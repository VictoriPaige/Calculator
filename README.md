Set up the initial state of your component. What state will you need to track? What values should those state items start with? Where is that state printed to the browser?
You will need to figure out how and when you want to listen for an event to trigger a calculation. Is it a click event, a submit event...? It's up to you to figure out what event you want to listen for, on which elements, and why. Here is a list of events React supports (Links to an external site.).
Once you know what event to listen for, you'll need to create a method that accepts the triggered event, gets the input values from your form, adds them together, and sets the state of the new sum.
thought: how will you handle inputs that aren't numbers?
Once the state of the sum has been set, React will re-render the whole component. Make sure you have a place in your JSX that displays the result!
Make the calculator work with any of the 4 basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). How will this change your state, and your JSX?
Style using Flexbox or CSS Grid.

Create a mobile version of this using media queries
Use touch events (Links to an external site.)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
